## Programming Joke
A QA engineer walk into the bar...

Then he orders 0 beers;

Then he orders 999999999999 beers;

Then he orders 1 beer;

Then he orders nothing;

Then he orders -1 beers;

Then he orders `NULL` beers;

Then he orders asnwikfjsdf;

Then he orders a `<script>give_me_your_credit_card()</script>`;

Finally, the QA engineer leaves without paying, comes back, and asks for the tab.

Satisfied, the QA engineer walks out of the bar.

A customer walks in to the bar and orders a steak. 

`<Exception Encountered>`
